The Kokkos team is announcing the first Kokkos Usergroup Meeting to be held in Albuquerque New Mexico, USA April 23rd through 25th. The meeting will give the growing Kokkos community a chance to present progress in adopting Kokkos, exchange experiences, discuss challenges and help set priorities for the future roadmap of Kokkos. Projects are invited to give a 20 minute presentation. Application talks are encouraged to focus on technical and algorithmic challenges in adopting Kokkos and how Kokkosâ€™s capabilities were used to overcome those.
